<h1>Ramadan 2022 | Quran Study üåô</h1>

<h2>Salaam's üëã</h2>
<p>This page is to help organize our schedule + reading material for our Qur'an study this Ramadan.</p>

<h2>Here's how it works üìù</h2>
<p>This is meant to be a way for us to stay spiritually and religiously engaged during Ramadan while maintaining full academic and/or work loads. Given that, we want this structure to be as flexible, forgiving, and acommodating as possible. Didn't read? No worries--the presenters will go over the reading in detail. Below is a rough outline of how we go about Qur'an study:
<ol type ="1">
	<li><b>Read</b> the scheduled material before our group meeting time, if you can.</li>
	<li><b>Prepare</b> for our group discussion. The goal is for everyone to add insight or their thoughts so that we can learn from each other. Think of some questions to share, and feel free to introduce other relevant sources (hadiths, tafsirs, etc.).</li>
	<li><b>Discuss</b> with the group; first 5-10 minutes will be a quick summary of the scheduled readings and the remaining time will be for discussion. We'll be taking notes as a group via Google Docs; everyone can contirbute.</li>
	<li><b>Follow-up</b>; we'll share some additional suggested learning materials (podcasts, articles, etc.) to supplement the surah we discussed for you to independently engage with during the week. That way we're learning during the weekend and continuing to reflect on it during the week. These will be uploaded Sunday night after our last discussion.</li>
</ol>
</p>
