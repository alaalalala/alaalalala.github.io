<h1>Ramadan 2020 | Quran Study 🌙</h1>

<h2>Salaam's! 👋</h2>
<p>This page is to help organize our schedule, reading material, & suggested supplementary material for our Qur'an study this Ramadan.</p>

<h2>Here's how it works 📝</h2>
<p>This is meant to be a way for us to stay spiritually and religiously engaged during Ramadan while maintaining full academic and/or work loads. To accomodate for that, there aren't many rules, and most of them are flexible. Didn't get a chance to read? No worries! Still join to benefit from the group discussion.
<ol type ="1">
	<li><b>Read</b> the scheduled material before our group meeting time, if you can.</li>
	<li><b>Prepare</b> for our group discussion. The goal is for everyone (ideally) to add insight or their thoughts so that we can learn from each other, so think of some things to share. Also feel free to use other sources (hadiths, tafsirs, etc.) that relate to the surah/themes.</li>
	<li><b>Discuss</b> with the group; first 5-10 minutes will be a quick summary of the scheduled ayah's and the remaining time will be for discussion. We'll be taking notes as a group via Google Docs, everyone can contirbute.</li>
	<li><b>Follow-up</b>; we'll share some additional suggested learning materials (podcasts, articles, etc.) to supplement the surah we discussed for you to independently engage with during the week. That way we're learning during the weekend and continuing to reflect on it during the week. These will be uploaded Sunday night after our last discussion.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Materials 📚</h2>
<p> We'll be using the following:
<ol type ="1">
